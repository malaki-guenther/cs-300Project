# cs-300Project

In Projects One and Two, I addressed the ABCU advising program’s needs by analyzing data structures (vectors, hash tables, and BSTs) in C++ for efficient course data management and developed a program to sort and display courses alphanumerically, leveraging vectors for simplicity and hash sets for validation, achieving O(n) loading for vectors and hash tables, and O(n·log n) for BSTs due to balanced insertions. Understanding data structures’ time and space complexities, like O(log n) BST lookups versus O(n) vector searches, was crucial for optimizing performance for frequent sorted outputs and lookups, as I recommended BSTs for their O(n) in-order traversal efficiency. Roadblocks, such as ensuring BST balance and handling parsing errors, were overcome by studying AVL tree balancing and rigorous edge-case testing. These projects enhanced my software design by prioritizing data structure selection based on use-case analysis, while adopting modular C++ functions and clear documentation improved my focus on writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code.
